The **JPet Store** website is a demo application created for testing purposes. It is an online store related to pet stores. Like most online stores, the user can browse products, add and remove products from the shopping cart, and order products in the shopping cart. The application is currently only available in a browser-based version. The goal of the project was to detect bugs and make sure that the functionality under test works properly.
