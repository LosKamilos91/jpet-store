The [**JPet Store**](https://jpetstore.mate.academy/jpetstore/actions/Catalog.action) is a demo web application designed for testing purposes. It simulates an online store for pet-related products. The application allows users to:
- Browse products.
- Add and remove items from the shopping cart.
- Place orders for items in the cart.

The primary goal of this project was to detect bugs and ensure the functionality under test operates correctly. Currently, the application is available only in a browser-based version. I also encourage you to take a look at the tasks to be completed in the future as part of the project by going to the “**Issues**” tab or by clicking [here](https://github.com/LosKamilos91/jpet-store/issues/1) to go to the list of tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> The document is for demonstration purposes and details the approach to testing a product developed from scratch for my own use. The project was carried out thanks to the support of [**Mate Academy**](https://mate.academy/pl), which provided the application to prepare the materials below. This project aims to ensure the high quality of the product after conducting detailed tests and verifying the functionality of the application in practice, as well as for educational purposes.

### 📋 1. Test Plan

A test plan was developed from scratch (by me) to represent the testing process. This plan presents:
- Objective & testing strategy,
- Resources,
- Schedule & Estimation of tests,
- Risks & Mitigation,
- Test Criteria.

A detailed overview can be found in the `test_plan.md` document in this repository.

### 📝 2. Requirements
The design follows specific functional and non-functional requirements to ensure the quality of the application. Key areas include:
- **Functional requirements**: verifying that the basic functions of the shopping cart work properly
- **Non-functional requirements**: $${\color{red}soon}$$

Detailed requirements can be found in the `requirements.md` file.

### 🔗 3. RTM (Requirements Traceability Matrix)
To ensure thorough testing, the **RTM (Requirements Traceability Matrix)** technique was used. This helped map test cases to requirements, ensuring full coverage of key shopping cart features. The detailed RTM document can be found in the `rtm.xlsx` file.

### 🔐 4. Permission Testing
Permission tests were conducted to check access levels for different users: **Logged-in user** and **Guest**. For details on permissions, please refer to the `permissions.xlsx` file.

## 📊 Summary
The JPet Store project is a demonstration and used for personal use showing a comprehensive web application testing process. The application has been tested manually and is ready for automated tests, which will be created based on the data placed in the project. I encourage you to check out the repository for more details about the project.
