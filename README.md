![Manual Testing](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Manual%20Testing-B3DDE0?style=for-the-badge)

The [**JPet Store**](https://jpetstore.mate.academy/jpetstore/actions/Catalog.action) is a demo web application designed for testing purposes. It simulates an online store for pet-related products. The application allows users to:
- Browse products.
- Add and remove items from the shopping cart.
- Place orders for items in the cart.

The primary goal of this project was to detect bugs and ensure the functionality under test operates correctly. Currently, the application is available only in a browser-based version.

> [!NOTE]
> The document is for demonstration purposes and details the approach to testing a product developed from scratch for my own use. The project was carried out thanks to the support of [**Mate Academy**](https://mate.academy/pl), which provided the application to prepare the materials below. This project aims to ensure the high quality of the product after conducting detailed tests and verifying the functionality of the application in practice, as well as for educational purposes.

### 📋 Test Plan

A test plan was developed from scratch (by me) to represent the testing process. This plan presents:
- Objective & testing strategy,
- Resources,
- Schedule & Estimation of tests,
- Risks & Mitigation,
- Test Criteria.

A detailed overview can be found in the `test_plan.md` document in this repository.

### 📝 Requirements
The design follows specific functional and non-functional requirements to ensure the quality of the application. Key areas include:
- **Functional requirements**: verifying that the basic functions of the shopping cart work properly
- **Non-functional requirements**: $${\color{red}soon}$$

Detailed requirements can be found in the `requirements.md` file.

### 🔗 RTM (Requirements Traceability Matrix)
To ensure thorough testing, the **RTM (Requirements Traceability Matrix)** technique was used. This helped map test cases to requirements, ensuring full coverage of key shopping cart features. The detailed RTM document can be found in the `rtm.xlsx` file.

### 🔐 Permission Testing
Permission tests were conducted to check access levels for different users: **Logged-in user** and **Guest**. For details on permissions, please refer to the `permissions.xlsx` file.










<!--



### 🧪 Test Cases
Test cases were designed and executed to verify the functionality of the shopping cart module. A total of 39 test cases were created using TestRail, categorized by:
- Functional tests
- GUI tests
- Boundary value analysis

All test cases can be found in the `test_cases.xlsx` file. To view them in TestRail, download and import the file.

### 🧩 Run Tests
Testing was performed across various categories:
- **Functional Testing**: Verifying core features like adding/removing items.
- **GUI Testing**: Ensuring the user interface is intuitive and error-free.

The detailed test execution report is available in the `test_execution.md` file.

### 🐞 Bug Reports
During testing, a total of 10 bugs were identified and documented. Each bug includes:
- Steps to reproduce.
- Expected vs actual results.
- Severity and priority.

Bug reports are documented in a shared Google Sheet, which can be accessed via the link provided in `bug_reports.md`.

### 📃 Test Reports
A final test report was created summarizing the testing activities, outcomes, and metrics. This report includes:
- Test coverage.
- Defect density.
- Recommendations for future improvements.

The detailed report is hosted in Confluence and can also be found in `test_report.md`.
